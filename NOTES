* binary image denoising

For single stage schemes, energy-based denoising performed best.
Overall though, the combination of energy-based denoising, and a
large-threshold windowed vote filter, performed best.

** windowed vote filters

The idea behind the window filter "box-2-18/24" is that, where there is
"near" unanimity (ex. 75%), it is safer to change a pixel (ex. "solid"
regions), but where contentious, error is more likely (ex. edges).

Judging from the output, box-2-18/24 is more for fine-tuning, as
applying it alone still leaves speckles, compared to applying it after
applying energy-based denoising. The other window filters can also be
applied in a similar fashion, but they (ex. (energy,diamond-2)) miss
some fine details, such as where there are many alternating edges
(ex. the spiral tip).

** energy function parameters

The energy function (proportional to the probability) is
\[
    E(Z=z,X=x) = h\sum_i z_i -\beta \sum_{(i,j)} z_iz_j -\nu\sum_i z_ix_i
\]
where x is the visible pixel, and z is the hidden pixel value, and h,
\beta, and \nu are parameters. This model captures individual nodes,
adjacent pixels edge potentials, and visible/hidden edge potentials.
Window filters only consider adjacent pixels.

#+begin_example
h = 0.0 # bias term
beta = 2.0 # neighbours are twice as "good" (informative?) compared to if a pixel were flipped
nu = 1.0
#+end_example

** problems with edit distance as error measure

In some cases, a lower edit distance might not correspond to a "better" restored image:
- same edit distance (ie. error), but mal-pixels clumped together stand out more
- there could be more flipped pixels along edges than a speckled image,
  but the latter is more noticeable despite having a lower error
